# Syndrome-Embedding-KNN-Analysis
This project uses a set of Python files to perform syndrome classification from embeddings stored in Pickle files. The main flow includes preprocessing, data exploration, classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and evaluation of metrics such as AUC, F1-Score, and Top-5 Accuracy.
