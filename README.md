# Syndrome-Embedding-KNN-Analysis
This project uses a set of Python files to perform syndrome classification from embeddings stored in Pickle files. The main flow includes preprocessing, data exploration, classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and evaluation of metrics such as AUC, F1-Score, and Top-5 Accuracy.

Run the Project: Run the main files depending on the desired functionality:

data_processing.py for data preprocessing.
classification.py for training and validating the KNN model.
data_visu.py for visualizing the embeddings.
metrics_evaluation.py for detailed evaluation of the metrics.

Inputs and Outputs:

Input: Pickle file containing embeddings organized by syndromes.
Output: Metrics, graphs and tables generated at runtime.
